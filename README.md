# What We Do
### Quantitative Market Research

Our approach to market research is comprehensive, combining the robustness of data science with the precision of mathematical analysis. We delve into:

- **Empirical Research**: Leveraging machine learning and econometrics to extract actionable insights from data generated by natural experiments, informing user and advertiser decision-making and predicting market movements.

- **Theoretical Research**: Developing and analyzing models to predict market dynamics using mathematical tools, including well-established models like the Bass diffusion and Steiner-Dorfman models.

### Pipeline Prototyping with OOP

Our commitment to efficient and robust code practices is realized through Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), enhancing:

- Troubleshooting efficiency
- Code reusability and flexibility
- Productivity
- Data management
- Security

### Education

We champion knowledge sharing by:

- Providing **Internal Training Programs** such as Data Bytes and ByteLearnings.

# Work With Us
We are more than a team—we are a collaborative hub that values fresh ideas and perspectives. Our operations go beyond regular workflows, and we are open to suggestions that can amplify our impact on TikTok’s marketing landscape. Here's what to expect when you work with us and what we hope you'll bring to the table.

### What to Expect from Us

Our research-focused team is built on a foundation of continuous communication and brainstorming. The typical lifecycle for our projects spans a minimum of 3 months and includes the following stages:

1. **Question Formation (1-2 weeks)**: We work with stakeholders to define the right questions, typically solidifying decisions during mid-quarters.

2. **Data Capture (1-3 months)**: This phase may involve data acquisition, entry, signal reception, extraction, and rigorous quality checks.

3. **Data Processing (2-3 weeks)**: Our team undertakes initial data engineering tasks such as data mining, clustering, classification, modeling, and summarization.

4. **Analysis (minimum of 3 weeks)**: We select the most fitting methodologies for exploratory, predictive, or causal research.

5. **Democratization/Communication (1-2 weeks)**: We document our findings and insights in a Feishu document, which encompasses data reporting, visualization, business intelligence, and decision-making support.

### What We Expect from You

To forge a successful partnership, we anticipate:

1. **During the Question Formation stage**:
   - A clear and concise proposal/BRD.
   - A proposed success metric and a plan for its implementation.

2. **Post-delivery or during the Democratization/Communication stage**:
   - Confirmation with PR/Comm about the eligibility for external sharing of our outputs.
   - Continuous tracking of the proposed metrics of success to ensure long-term efficacy and alignment.

We look forward to innovative collaborations that will push the boundaries of marketing science.
